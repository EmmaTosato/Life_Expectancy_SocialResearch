# Life_Expectancy_SocialResearch
Social Research Project 2022-2023 on Life Expectancy

## About Dataset
### What is Life Expectancy
The term “life expectancy” refers to the number of years a person can expect to live. By definition, life expectancy is based on an estimate of the average age members of a particular population group will be when they die.

## Content
The dataset focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors as well.

The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries. So, the data-set related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from United Nation website. Among all categories of factors, only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative.

It has been observed that in the past 15 years , there has been a huge development in health sector resulting in improvement of human mortality rates especially in the developing nations in comparison to the past 30 years. Therefore, in this project we have considered data from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries for further analysis.

## Research's questions and methods
### Questions
The main question on which we can concentrate on, is how different socioeconomic factors, immunization-related factors, mortality factors, and economic factors are related and influence life expectancy (our target variable).

We will then go on to view some factors individually in order to answer some questions such as:
- How Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?
- Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative correlation with eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc.
- What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?
- Does Life Expectancy have a positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol?
- Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?
- What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?
- etc...

### Method

We will study this dataset through a Quantitative Analysis, since the dataset contains for the most numerical variables. Thus we can reply to quantitative answers, numerical changes in variables and analyze the some phenomena related to life expectancy. As said before, the final aim is to assess relationship between various factors and life expectancy.

We will perform:
- statistical analyses such as correlation analysis and hypothesis testing
- machine learning models (regressions models), to understand whether it is indeed possible to predict life expectancy through the factors available to us
- dimensionality reduction.
